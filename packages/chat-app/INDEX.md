# Chat App

Brand-neutral, client-only Chat product composition shared by every Site project and `apps/user`.
It owns browser Session transport, Chat orchestration, command reconciliation, session organization,
and the runnable React surface. It never receives Platform credentials, workload credentials,
deployment bindings, or backend URLs; those remain in the same-origin Site BFF.

Branding, published model catalogs, enabled surfaces, projects, and browser CSRF are injected via
the browser-safe `PublicSiteBootstrap` projection. A Site that does not publish Chat does not render it.
